# hello-world
my first repository
Hey I'm in high school, I've been coding since I was 10 or so. I know javascript, python, java, and a bit of C++. I've done some web stuff too, HTML/CSS/SQL/PHP all that stuff. I hate PHP with the passsion of a thousand flaming suns. I learned everything I know about web development from a thick Dummies book that's so old it talks about adjusting for IE6.
